* Do not need batteries 
* Could be charged by standard smart-phone charger or by a computer USB port in few seconds
* It is robustness and almost waterproof

## Do this flashlight needs to be turned off?

No, it could shine all night until full discharge. It allows very robust design without mechanic switches. You only need a smart-phone charger or microUSB cable and USB port to light-up the flashlight again.
